00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.820
Chen Liang: Okay?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.510
Chen Liang: Alright so

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.970
Chen Liang: that's such.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.179
Chen Liang: Let me let me delete all this

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.460
screen.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.350
Chen Liang: Hello! My name is Gregory Crosale, and I'm a Phd. Student at the University of Michigan.

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:47.419
Chen Liang: Thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. But the goal of this is to evaluate 2 different interfaces. Okay, so first, we're gonna walk through a couple of demos and tutorials of these interfaces. And I'm gonna give you a few tasks that I'm going to ask you to perform.

8
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.840
Chen Liang: Okay? So

9
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.130
Chen Liang: first. I'm going to send you a link actually, first, I'll do this myself.

10
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.680
Chen Liang: Are you familiar with Tap? Qbt. Yes.

11
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:34.179
Chen Liang: So this is an interface. A lot designed to be a lot like Chachpe. Actually, let me send this link to you so it will be recorded. But I don't do this on your computer.

12
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.340
Chen Liang: Okay?

13
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.010
Chen Liang: Oh, you are. By the way, this is on room.

14
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.340
Chen Liang: This one's it's it's okay.

15
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.319
Chen Liang: So this is an interface, a lot like chat. Vpt, okay, except.

16
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.799
Chen Liang: it's using some slightly different features. So I'm just gonna show you very, basically a couple of things.

17
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.050
So, for example, you might ask.

18
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.300
Chen Liang: what is the University

19
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.440
Chen Liang: of Michigan?

20
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.130
Chen Liang: And then, if I press, enter.

21
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.950
we'll see. The response will slowly be generated. Umhm.

22
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.540
Chen Liang: just like some more advanced versions of Chat Gp. you can also include images.

23
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.110
Chen Liang: So I can say, describe this image and how it relates to the previous question.

24
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.000
Chen Liang: Let's wait until it's done talking. Actually, no, I don't. We don't need to. We can go ahead, and

25
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.999
Chen Liang: and then we'll see the answer also, like some more advanced versions of Chat Gpt. This can generate images, for you

26
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.530
Chen Liang: create a picture

27
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.570
Chen Liang: of this figure

28
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.180
Chen Liang: at the location was talking

29
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.539
Chen Liang: before it.

30
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.500
Chen Liang: and this will just take some time.

31
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.609
Chen Liang: and then we'll see it's gonna make some pictures for us.

32
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.209
Chen Liang: Okay, so any questions right off the bat about this interface. Nope.

33
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.620
Chen Liang: can you go ahead and just ask it to make any picture you want?

34
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.060
Chen Liang: Okay.

35
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.499
Chen Liang: those are crowded rooms.

36
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.539
Chen Liang: Okay? And then can you refresh for me.

37
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.500
Chen Liang: And now, can you upload a picture for me in this interface? And we use the deck?

38
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.080
Chen Liang: Yeah. And now just say something relating to that.

39
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.779
Chen Liang: And I think, yeah.

40
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.119
Chen Liang: yeah, that's fine

41
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.070
Chen Liang: oops, something better. Let me see.

42
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.260
Chen Liang: Oh, I'm sorry. But I cannot edit.

43
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.779
Chen Liang: Okay, that's fine.

44
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:57.009
Chen Liang: any questions about this so far also. One thing so. And this is a feature we're thinking about deleting. You can edit both responses. So if it doesn't respond in the way that you want, you can actually go back and say

45
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.299
Chen Liang: Yes a little bit.

46
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.110
Chen Liang: I'll generate an image in the same style.

47
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.340
Chen Liang: But with Jerry as the main character.

48
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.829
Chen Liang: And then, now here, I can say.

49
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.629
Chen Liang: okay, okay.

50
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.219
Chen Liang: this is taking so long. So you see, you can kind of manipulate it a little bit

51
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.450
Chen Liang: works. Yeah.

52
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.320
Chen Liang: okay, so any other questions about this interview so far. Okay.

53
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.400
Chen Liang: so now, I'm gonna show you deck flow.

54
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.550
Chen Liang: You open the link that I sent you in zoom and go ahead and close this interface for me as well.

55
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.560
Chen Liang: And then this needs to be in power phones. Okay?

56
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.070
Chen Liang: And

57
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.399
Chen Liang: is that risk.

58
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.920
Chen Liang: That's so funny. Yes, you you can't accept risk.

59
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.970
Chen Liang: I think I need to add certificate authority. Yes.

60
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.819
Chen Liang: Slide, we

61
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.170
Chen Liang: no, you're good.

62
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:44.109
Chen Liang: Yeah. You can just click, accept the risk. Oh, actually, maybe the web socket won't work because of this. That's the first time I've seen this

63
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.330
refresh

64
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.760
Chen Liang: refresh. Okay. take it.

65
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.590
Chen Liang: Okay, okay.

66
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:31.749
Chen Liang: so this is that flow. This is an alternative way to create anything you want, pretty much so to start out the way that you create new things is with this goal card.

67
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.209
Chen Liang: And very basically, all you have to do is type what you went in here. So if I wanted to.

68
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:45.320
Chen Liang:  I can even ask a question here, like, Who is Tom from on end? Jerry?

69
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:55.410
Chen Liang: Okay. I'll get some responses here. and just like the previous interface. you can ask it to make images as well.

70
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.539
Chen Liang: and we'll see these images will come out.

71
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.580
Chen Liang: But, unlike the previous interface

72
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:26.760
Chen Liang: this allows you to manipulate the feedback that you give it so rather than exactly what you would have written before you can kind of choose dynamically.

73
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.170
So, for example.

74
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.839
Chen Liang: let's say, I wanted to

75
00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.360
Chen Liang: create a dynamic.

76
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:43.670
Chen Liang: I'll just say, create an image here. And then here, I'll put this style. I want this to be

77
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.720
Chen Liang: dramatic photographs

78
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.760
Chen Liang: here. I want the subject to be.

79
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.090
Chen Liang: and I can even go down here and pick the one I like the most. So I actually really like this one.

80
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.009
Chen Liang: and can drag this in here.

81
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:07.589
Chen Liang: and then for colors. Let's say I wanted to use like a lot of like neon colors.

82
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.450
Chen Liang: What I could do is say like.

83
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.730
Chen Liang: describe

84
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.040
Chen Liang: some neon colors.

85
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.880
Chen Liang: get some ideas here.

86
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.379
Chen Liang: and then I could look at the ones that I like, and actually drag them over here.

87
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.490
Chen Liang: and then I can press C to put this in a cluster, which means these kind of belong in the same idea.

88
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.180
Chen Liang: And I can just drag this here.

89
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.559
Chen Liang: And now let's see what happens.

90
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.320
Chen Liang: Increase.

91
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.670
Chen Liang: Wow!

92
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.120
Chen Liang: Any questions for me so far. No.

93
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.130
Chen Liang: okay.

94
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:27.970
Chen Liang: Now, I would like for you. And also there's a anything you're familiar with, like from illustrator or Google slides. There's a lot of those interactions. So you can from most things undo and redo, you can press alt and drag to copy

95
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.650
Chen Liang: back spaces to delete.

96
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:43.760
Chen Liang: Yeah. And then for this, if you want to remove a connection, all you have to do is drag it a little bit and then let go, and then to delete one of these. You just have to make it empty.

97
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:57.570
Chen Liang: and then all that you can also undo you. Okay. So now, I want you to go ahead and just create some text using the goal card. Any any thanks, any

98
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:34.730
Chen Liang: any questions about that? Now, I'm going to ask you to create an image using a goalcard.

99
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.760
Chen Liang: Thanks.

100
00:11:39.460 --> 00:12:08.970
Chen Liang: We already does one. Yeah, that's pretty funny. It's decided to give you some motivational images. Oh, and another thing I forgot to tell you. If you're if you kind of forget where something came from, you can click here and we'll show you. If you highlight here, we'll show you what directly influenced it. And then here's some information from the back end, so you can see what prompts you. So a person standing on a mountain books reaching for the stars. And then here, you see, it's kind of a different problem. So if you're curious about what I used here

101
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.690
Chen Liang: can use those same things. And again, click, and we'll just send you over there.

102
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.320
Chen Liang: Yeah. But go ahead and like, ask it to make it. This I just decided to make it, which is for you

103
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.350
Chen Liang:  and then from here, select a few that you like.

104
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:25.710
Chen Liang: and maybe some that you don't like, I would say, a total of 4 images. The more images you have, the longer it will take and put them in a cluster. So make 2 groups of 2 images.

105
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.670
Chen Liang: one like one dislike. It could be anything you want. Hmm.

106
00:13:49.090 --> 00:14:00.979
Chen Liang: okay. and now you can use those has context for one more generation of that.

107
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.770
Chen Liang: So let's say

108
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.989
Chen Liang: you want you just use that as like a vocabulary. Umhm.

109
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.510
Chen Liang: or actually, I can copy this. Yeah.

110
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.260
Chen Liang: where's alder option? Well.

111
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.160
Chen Liang: most stuff or not like this is probably

112
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:55.660
Chen Liang: okay. So this one will probably take a while because of how many images we have.

113
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:03.770
Chen Liang: So actually. And can you take 2 out of each cluster? Just so it doesn't take a long time. Okay.

114
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.439
Chen Liang: and then drag it like down here, so it doesn't

115
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.690
Chen Liang: cover perfect.

116
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.900
Chen Liang: And then, yeah, go ahead.

117
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:49.629
Chen Liang: Do you feel motivated? Yes, I don't even understand what they're saying. But yes, what do you mean you don't understand

118
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.250
the the regret.

119
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.480
Chen Liang: Okay, cool

120
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.030
Chen Liang: now any questions before we continue.

121
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.980
Chen Liang: And can you just look at the history of one of those cards for me.

122
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.980
Chen Liang: Let's go with this one.

123
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.660
Chen Liang: Show me that influence that it perfect.

124
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.300
Chen Liang: Excellent!

125
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.870
Chen Liang: No other questions, Umhm.

126
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.900
Chen Liang: So now

127
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.860
Chen Liang: I'm gonna give you an image.

128
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:51.690
Chen Liang: and I would like, Oh, one more thing. You can also drag external images here. So go and try to do that with the Tom picture.

129
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.530
Chen Liang: There you go.

130
00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:10.629
Chen Liang: Okay. Another thing. Can you press, command a, and just get rid of everything we've done so far perfect. Okay. I would like for you to recreate this image as closely as possible without actually using the image.

131
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:43.490
Chen Liang: Can you describe to me what we've just done? I just describe the image as text in the go card.

132
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.280
Chen Liang: Basically, it's just like.

133
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.380
Chen Liang: right here, I'll text for your image and see what the

134
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.310
Chen Liang: system does. Okay.

135
00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.620
Chen Liang: what do you think about this initial output. I think it's pretty good.

136
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.780
Chen Liang: But there are definitely

137
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:10.129
Chen Liang: space to improve. Because I I noted the style is a little bit different. So maybe.

138
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.620
Chen Liang: Yeah.

139
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.880
Chen Liang: go ahead and keep trying to make as possible. Yeah.

140
00:19:22.780 --> 00:20:11.050
Chen Liang:  make sure you click on private. So yeah.

141
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.419
Chen Liang: you describe what you just click there.

142
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:14.830
Chen Liang: I'm trying to generate some style I want to face some input image so that they know what style I'm looking for. So I started by

143
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.290
Chen Liang: asking, kind of generism, painting of houses?

144
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.410
Chen Liang:  yeah.

145
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.059
Chen Liang: And this one is probably the closest.

146
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.179
Chen Liang: Yeah, actually, this. Well, yeah, there's one.

147
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.970
Chen Liang: Can you describe to me what you did over here. I'm just combining

148
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:04.719
Chen Liang: So I'm trying to capture the style of the picture you front of me. And I started by asking

149
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.360
Chen Liang: the interest to generate some painting.

150
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:15.930
Chen Liang: and then I select some. some of them, and make it more bright and as higher saturation as

151
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:24.179
Chen Liang: the similar to the image you you have. And then pick one of those

152
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:31.349
Chen Liang: as a reference to the style, and fit this into the go card

153
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.549
Chen Liang: the Co. Go card listed. I mean, there's

154
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:46.369
Chen Liang: expected images and images not expected image on another category of style and company, and it would generate this.

155
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:57.749
Chen Liang: So one thing I'm noticing is that even though you said not super similar to it, looks like it copied where it has 2 images. So maybe let's go like zoom into one of those.

156
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.510
Chen Liang: and let's click that. Yeah, let's click. I here.

157
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.049
Chen Liang: and can you

158
00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.750
scroll? You have to click the scroll bar on this

159
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.190
Chen Liang: scroll down.

160
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.030
Chen Liang: So this one, it says. 2 houses. Okay? So it.

161
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:25.829
Chen Liang: It thinks that the image generator has access to the reference images is what's happening.

162
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:40.140
Chen Liang: So. But the way we're I want to do this in here to say. But the way works back at is that chattypt. Let me show you

163
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.480
Chen Liang: they have chat. Gpt, right?

164
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.430
Chen Liang: This is the system for change.

165
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.649
Chen Liang: Okay. so I say that.

166
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.609
Chen Liang:  you can create images by

167
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.010
Chen Liang: giving the user this image tag.

168
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:30.659
Chen Liang: it thinks that. And then what what happens is I parse the response, and if the response includes this image tag, then I send it to the image generator. I don't use the function protocol, because that makes it wait for the result, and I don't want it to wait. So it said, similar to the 2 reference images.

169
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:41.260
Chen Liang: because it knows it has access to the 2 reference images. But stable diffusion doesn't have access to those reference images. So I think that's kind of where where things went wrong here.

170
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.800
Chen Liang: So

171
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.729
Chen Liang: maybe if we do something like.

172
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.560
Chen Liang: and this is the style you wanted here.

173
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.040
Chen Liang: this out

174
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.470
Chen Liang: already. These are

175
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.620
Chen Liang: pretty good. But yeah, you got some good images right off the bat.

176
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.510
Chen Liang: Nope.

177
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.220
Chen Liang: okay.

178
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.799
Chen Liang: any thoughts before before it

179
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.500
Chen Liang: which one you like the best you like this one the best, right? Yeah.

180
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.170
Or was that this one

181
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.080
Chen Liang: really got the like angles down.

182
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.310
Chen Liang: you know.

183
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.840
Chen Liang: I wonder if this is a similar style

184
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:23.389
Chen Liang: like, if this is a famous style. Okay? So let's move on to another task.

185
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.299
Chen Liang: Can you go back to the Chat Gpus for you?

186
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.139
Chen Liang: I'm gonna make a couple adjustments here in the back end

187
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.399
Chen Liang: that and can you refresh from you real quick?

188
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.960
Chen Liang: Now, I would like you to do a similar task

189
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.460
Chen Liang: with this image.

190
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.669
Chen Liang: It's just gonna make one.

191
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.539
Chen Liang: Oh, and this is the end

192
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.469
Chen Liang: I asked it to.

193
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.800
Chen Liang: It's not great. At public instructions

194
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.699
Chen Liang: members takes. Oh, you're on edge, too.

195
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:25.680
Chen Liang: Okay.

196
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.420
Chen Liang: big Buck, you can't it?

197
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:38.440
Chen Liang: Did we try using an image before? Oh, I know. The problem is, if you don't upload the image.

198
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.839
Chen Liang: Then, okay, so for right now.

199
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.300
Chen Liang: do we hit and save the image.

200
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.130
Chen Liang: Umhm.

201
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.980
Chen Liang: Then

202
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.029
Chen Liang: the right ones

203
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.750
Chen Liang: was the right one.

204
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.760
Chen Liang: Hmm! There wasn't okay, anyway.

205
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:51.130
Chen Liang: I think you get the idea. Sorry that the this part of the demo broke questions about any of this.

206
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.209
Chen Liang: Okay, cool do you want to try another type of task.

207
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.750
Chen Liang: Why not? Okay?

208
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.250
Chen Liang: So now.

209
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.580
Chen Liang: and you make a picture

210
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:16.969
Chen Liang: of something that you might want to. And let's do this in deck because it seems to be working actually.

211
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:23.869
Chen Liang: can you make a picture of something that you might want to hang up in your dining room? Yeah, this is fine. Go ahead and press. Command A and minus for me.

212
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.969
Chen Liang: And also, would you mind closing the other window and edge

213
00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.350
Chen Liang: alright? Oh, you already close it. Yeah.

214
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.130
Chen Liang: and negotiate. Change the vacuum.

215
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.320
Chen Liang: We do.

216
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.930
Chen Liang: You can do whatever you want.

217
00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.990
Chen Liang: That doesn't

218
00:36:50.320 --> 00:38:24.470
Chen Liang:  crazy? How often it says, no.

219
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.460
Chen Liang: neither ending the warts. You? Okay. yeah. Right?

220
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.370
Chen Liang: Oops.

221
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.020
Chen Liang: this is going to take a while because of the uploading images.

222
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:44.149
Chen Liang: Oh, wow! I think that one really worked. Yeah, there's these.

223
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.230
Chen Liang: And I mean, do you have any questions for me? No.

224
00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:02.460
Chen Liang: there are some good ones.

225
00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:14.500
Chen Liang: Look at this. Oh, wow! Didn't look at this.

226
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.980
Chen Liang: Yeah, yeah. okay.

227
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.779
Chen Liang: anything else you can. Happy with this. I'm worrying like.

228
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:22.910
Chen Liang: okay.

229
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:28.730
Chen Liang: give me your thoughts. What do you think? Well, first, what do you think about the tasks I gave you.

230
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.449
Chen Liang: I think it's those are pretty common tasks.

231
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.810
Chen Liang: I think that.

232
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:45.989
Chen Liang: And for the final user study it will be more well defined. So. And also I won't be like, you know, I think I'll have a slide show.

233
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:51.629
Chen Liang: what do you think would be some? Okay, let me also just pull up a Google Doc here.

234
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.870
that's that's

235
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.220
Chen Liang: 10,

236
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:08.590
Chen Liang: 3, 8,

237
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.700
Chen Liang: 24. Okay?

238
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:18.219
Chen Liang: I guess. So big questions. I have, what are some? So we call this hard task and soft task.

239
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:24.360
Chen Liang: What are some other soft tasks that you could think of? So this one? I said something you might want to hang up in your living room.

240
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.940
Chen Liang: Those are the soft tusks.

241
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:36.100
Chen Liang: so other ideas that we had so something to hear in the app living slash. Dying.

242
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.630
Chen Liang: Emily had the idea of. What do your pets do

243
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:43.960
Chen Liang: while you're

244
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:57.320
Chen Liang: away? But then it's it's tax on the drug. No, they create an image all of what your pets do while you're away. The only thing is, not everyone has pets, you know.

245
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.080
Chen Liang: but like, maybe, like what people's pets do while they're away.

246
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.700
Chen Liang: More. What would be.

247
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.060
Chen Liang: What happened is

248
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:19.149
Chen Liang: no like, what will I look like in 20 years?

249
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:25.200
Chen Liang: Okay, or generate a opinion of me in 20 years. So

250
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.150
Chen Liang: here, there could be different styles, different occupations.

251
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.550
Chen Liang: different characteristics.

252
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.570
Chen Liang: Maybe that's something that kind.

253
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:47.209
Chen Liang: And there are multiple interactions fully utilized. All the nodes. Yeah. or. yeah, something similar.

254
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.140
Chen Liang: Yeah.

255
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.030
Chen Liang: I mean.

256
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:08.930
Chen Liang: create something to put in the living room is I feel like, it's a mega soft task. Yeah, because it's essentially create an image you like

257
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:16.580
Chen Liang: right? Well, it's and one thing I was thinking was like dining room, because, like you, it is expressive, you know.

258
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:33.669
Chen Liang: I wouldn't want to just put any image that I like up in my dining room. I would want it to be something that really I would like to show other people. But you're right. It is a very soft task. I really do want opportunities to let people flex their creativity, though. Yeah.

259
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:41.000
Chen Liang:  I feel like painting is a pretty decent one.

260
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.420
Chen Liang: so like PIN Hand.

261
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:48.520
Chen Liang: you have some expectations, common expectations.

262
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.420
Chen Liang: and you also have some creativity there.

263
00:43:51.640 --> 00:44:05.219
Chen Liang: So let's say, if you want them to generate more than art, then that's a different thing, because the variance is too large that it's hard to make all people happy because there's no common

264
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.920
Chen Liang: agreement on what the that thing should look like.

265
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.780
Chen Liang: So I think, Penny, that good idea.

266
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:29.899
Chen Liang: I was. I was previous previous previously thinking, adding some text to the image. But I don't think that perform super. Well. Okay.

267
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:41.179
Chen Liang: that's one thing that I think I could do actually is. Because what what if I just had like a specialized model? If someone asks to add text to an image.

268
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.959
Chen Liang: And I just put

269
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.239
Chen Liang: text, I didn't use any like AI. I just put text on the image where they wanted it. Nice hard work.

270
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:56.910
Chen Liang: I read it and crack it like this. I think there are some specialized models just for text that I could utilize.

271
00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:05.429
Chen Liang: Yeah, maybe. But II guess it's beyond. I think yeah. text on image

272
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:15.419
Chen Liang: would be cool beyond. Let's go do you think it's a fair comparison with touch? Gpt. The fake gpt we created

273
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:31.510
Chen Liang: sort of, I guess. I mean, that's all Gp. Has.

274
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:45.949
Chen Liang: It may not be super fair, but it's just your comparing tool chat, chat. Gp. do I mean, do you think that our fake Chat Gbt is like real chat. I think so.

275
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:53.409
Chen Liang:  I think it's even more than 20. Pt, because I have it.

276
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:05.420
Chen Liang: Anything else about user study.

277
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:14.499
Chen Liang: Yeah, well, first about this talk about the interfaces, and then you can give me some advice for resigning the study protocol. I mean, the interface is great.

278
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:24.059
Chen Liang:  II cannot think about

279
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:31.730
Chen Liang: somewhere. A good idea right now, because eat. But the thing is

280
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.720
Chen Liang: I guess one way to think about is

281
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:40.190
Chen Liang: try to maybe try. Think about some nonlinear tasks.

282
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.649
Chen Liang: chant Gbts

283
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:55.500
Chen Liang: completely linear. If there's a linear task then. and may not make enough difference between your interviews and the tangibility. So one thing I was considering was

284
00:46:55.580 --> 00:47:04.519
Chen Liang: adding a modifier to a task. So after 5 min, say, actually do this so that way, they have to kind of adjust

285
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.370
Chen Liang: on this

286
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:08.630
Chen Liang: for both. Yeah.

287
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.170
Chen Liang: so like for this task.

288
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:23.690
Chen Liang: I'd be like, now make a picture of what that looks like 50 years in the future. So you still can use

289
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:28.510
Chen Liang: some of the assets you have. But it's not just linear.

290
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.480
Chen Liang: Okay.

291
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:51.380
Chen Liang: But then I don't know. I feel like, and that's additional work. Additional work for me. Yeah. no. I just have to come up with prompts because you could do it right now. right? Yeah.

292
00:47:52.420 --> 00:48:02.710
Chen Liang:  And also probably ask the participants for preparing some images

293
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:10.680
Chen Liang: or so that they can use this tag. I guess most of the thing we do are

294
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:18.209
Chen Liang: gold gold car. I haven't even used the text card before.

295
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.590
Chen Liang: Right?

296
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.590
Chen Liang: Yeah. Like, if you have that image adding X to image model, then

297
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:35.910
Chen Liang: you can year. The integrate text card into it image card is only from the generated results. There's no

298
00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.519
Chen Liang: I don't deliver to use that

299
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:46.809
Chen Liang: well. And one thing that she did was she looked up like old farmhouse. And then she was like.

300
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.730
Chen Liang: I see. Actually, I think this will work

301
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.460
Chen Liang: beans crazy.

302
00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:03.070
Chen Liang: this, but with a minute. Right?

303
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.570
Chen Liang: And one thing.

304
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.900
Chen Liang: actually, that I want to encourage in the demo is for people to do more modular.

305
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.740
Chen Liang: So this.

306
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.420
Chen Liang: yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.170
Chen Liang: yeah. Yeah.

308
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:51.709
Chen Liang: so okay, I'll encourage that. Then if if it's if we making it more modular, then you can actually

309
00:49:51.840 --> 00:50:06.849
Chen Liang: think about more complicated tasks that involve more than one goal. So you you probably not creating a one image. But you are creating a set of image or or something that you can reuse all the

310
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.040
Chen Liang: stop over here.

311
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:16.649
Chen Liang:  that will also save a lot of time compared to Chpbie. And that's also one of your

312
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.010
Chen Liang: yeah anything else.

313
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.240
Chen Liang: And so

314
00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:35.070
Chen Liang: I mean literally, it's a cool interface.

315
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:43.109
Chen Liang: I got it alright. Thank you so much for your participation. I mean extensively.

316
00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:51.309
Chen Liang: I mean, II think it's really II think it's really fun. That's one of the big things that I wanted it to be is like, because

317
00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.610
Chen Liang: the thing is

318
00:50:52.830 --> 00:51:12.980
Chen Liang: typing on a Jupiter notebook is not a fun, you know, it's fun to get the output. But this way, you can really just like, yeah, yeah, drag stuff around. I previously worried about. Some people will recreate or have similar ideas like this. But consider all like design. Today, I tried all the functionality.

319
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.629
Chen Liang: There's a technical barrier over there, I think that'll

320
00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:27.940
Chen Liang: gosh took so long. Bro, but thanks so much. Cool. Well, thank you again for your participation. I'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording.
